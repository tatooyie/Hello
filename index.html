					 <h2>1. You make me happy in all aspects</h2>
					 <p>Making someone happy is one thing that I do to try to brighten someone's mood. <br>Before I met you, one thing that can make me happy is the existence of food.<br> I am a jolly person but I also have my lowest points , and everytime that I'm in <br> that scenario you've always been there to save me.<br> I've said that food makes me happy but now you're my number one source of happiness. </p>
					 <p>*but in case we fight i'll be just going back to food for a while HAHAHAHHH</p>

					<h2>2. You have a good heart</h2>
					<p>I know that I did a lot of mistakes before our relationship and during our<br> relationship yet you're still there and welcomes me so many times with<br> open arms. I've never been this greatful and i just know that you are the<br> person that I don't want to lose. I also love that you always remind me<br> to show kindness even if I'm really pissed at someone. Couldnt thank you<br> enough for all the things that you've helped me with.</p>

					<h2>3. You treat me right</h2>
					<p>You're just doing your job bc I'm your boss char hahaahha!<br> Honestly, you make me feel like a princess. A lot of people<br>have also treated me right before, but I can't compare their <br>treatment with yours. You care in every single detail about <br>me and I know that sometimes I probably have mistaken<br>that you don't care because on how you react to some things <br> but I can feel you're sincerity everytime you apologize. <br>Thank you for being patient with me my love. I know<br> that there are times that I might've been harsh with you <br>because I'm dealing with some personal issues but please <br>dont think that I am actually thinking that you're one of <br>them please don't get tired of me love.</p>
