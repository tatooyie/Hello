1. You make me happy in all aspects
Making someone happy is one thing that I do to try to brighten someone's mood. Before I met you, one thing that can make me happy is the existence on food. I am a jolly person but I also have my lowest points , and everytime that I'm in that scenario you've always been there to save me. I've said that food makes me happy but now you're my number one source of happiness. 

*but in case we fight i'll be just going back to food for a while HAHHHHAHA 

2. You have a good heart
I know that I did a lot of mistakes before our relationship and during our relationship yet you're still there and welcomes me so many times with open arms. I've never been this greatful and i just know that you are the person that I don't want to lose. I also love that you always remind me to show kindness even if I'm really pissed at someone. Couldnt thank you enough for all the things that you've helped me with.

3. You treat me right
You're just doing your job bc I'm your boss char hahaahha! Honestly, you make me feel like a princess. A lot of people have also treated me right before, but I can't compare their treatment with yours. You care in every single detail about me and I know that sometimes I probably have mistaken that you don't care because on how you react to some things but I can feel you're sincerity everytime you apologize. Thank you for being patient with me my love. I know that there are times that I might've been harsh with you because I'm dealing with some personal issues but please dont think that I am actually thinking that you're one of them please don't get tired of me love.
